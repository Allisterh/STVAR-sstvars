#' @title Calculate upper bound for the joint spectral radius of the "bold A" matrices
#'
#' @description \code{bound_jsr_JP} calculates an upper bound for the joint spectral radius of the "bold A" matrices
#' as described in Parrilo and Jadbabaie (2008), Theorems 4.2 and 4.3 and Equations (8) and (11).
#'
#' @param all_boldA all \eqn{((dp)x(dp))} "bold A" (companion form) matrices in a 3D array,
#'  so that \code{[, , m]} gives the matrix the regime \code{m}.
#' @param accuracy what should the relative accuracy of the bounds be? Note only upper bound is used
#'  and that the bound holds with any accuracy (but the bounds get tighter with increased accuracy).
#' @details Upper bound calculated the formula presented in Parrilo and Jadbabaie (2008), Equation~(11),
#'  whereas the accuracy is based on  Parrilo and Jadbabaie (2008), Table 1. Note that the accuracy is
#'  for the bounds including the lower bound which we do not calculate, as only upper bound used in practice.
#'  Specifically, Kheifets and Saikkonen (2020) show that if the joint spectral radius is smaller than one,
#'  the STVAR process is ergodic stationary. Therefore, if the upper bound is smaller than one,
#'  the process is stationary ergodic. However, as the condition is not necessary but sufficient and also because
#'  the bound might be too conservative, upper bound larger than one does not imply that the process is not ergodic
#'  stationary. You can try higher accuracy, and if the bound is still larger than one, the result does not tell
#'  whether the process is ergodic stationary or not.
#'
#'  Note that due to the extremely large dimenions required in the calculation of the bound, using high accuracy
#'  might not be feasible for other than very small models (small p*d^2), as one may run out of memory or the
#'  computations just take very long. \strong{That is, it is advisable to start with low accuracy,
#'  and only increase it if the sufficient condition for ergodic stationarity is not satisfied in the upper bound,
#'  i.e., if the bound is larger than one.}
#'  You can also try other implementations for bounding the joint spectral radius, for instance,
#'  the JSR toolbox in Matlab (Jungers 2023).
#' @return Returns an upper bound for the joint spectral radius of the "companion form AR matrices" of the regimes.

#' @title Calculate upper bound for the joint spectral radius of a set of matrices
#'
#' @description \code{bound_jsr_G} calculates lowr and upper bounds for the joint spectral radious of a set of square matrices,
#'  typically the "bold A" matrices, using the algorithm by Gripenberg (1996)
#'
#' @param S the set of matrices the bounds should be calculated for in an array, in VAR applications,
#'  all \eqn{((dp)x(dp))} "bold A" (companion form) matrices in a 3D array, so that \code{[, , m]} gives the matrix
#'  the regime \code{m}.
#' @param epsilon a strictly positive real number specifying the absolute accuracy of the bounds (which will be approximate
#'  in practice). Smaller number gives better accuracy but requires more substantial computational effort.
#' @details The bounds are calculated using the Gripenberg's (1996) branch-and-bound method, which is also discussed
#'  in Chand and Blondel (2013). Specifically, Kheifets and Saikkonen (2020) show that if the joint spectral radius
#'  of the companion form AR matrices of the regimes is smaller than one, the STVAR process is ergodic stationary. Therefore,
#'  if the upper bound is smaller than one, the process is stationary ergodic. However, as the condition is not
#'  necessary but sufficient and also because the bound might be too conservative, upper bound larger than one
#'  does not imply that the process is not ergodic stationary. You can try higher accuracy, and if the bound is
#'  still larger than one, the result does not tell whether the process is ergodic stationary or not.
#'
#'  Note that with high precision (small \code{epsilon}), the computational effort required are substantial and
#'  the estimation may take very long.
#'
#'  You can also try other implementations for bounding the joint spectral radius, for instance,
#'  the JSR toolbox in Matlab (Jungers 2023).
#' @return Returns an upper bound for the joint spectral radius of the "companion form AR matrices" of the regimes.
