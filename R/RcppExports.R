#' @name Gaussian_densities_Cpp
#' @title Calculate log multivariate Gaussian densities
#' @description Calculates logs of multivariate Gaussian densities with varying mean
#'   and varying covariance matrix AND EXCLUDING the constant term of the density
#'   (the constant is calculated and added in R code). The varying conditional covariance
#'   matrix is calculated within the function from the regime covariance matrices and
#'   transition weights.
#'
#' @param obs a \eqn{(T \times d)} matrix such that the i:th row contains the vector
#'  \eqn{y_{i}=(y_{1i},...,y_{di})} \eqn{(dx1)}. That is, the initial values are
#'  excluded but the last observations is included.
#' @param means a \eqn{(T \times d)} matrix such that the i:th row contains the
#'   conditional mean of the process \eqn{\mu_{y,i}}.
#' @param covmats a \eqn{(d \times d \times M)} array such that the slice \code{[, , m]}
#'   contains the conditional covariance matrix of regime m.
#' @param alpha_mt a \eqn{(T \times M)} matrix such that \code{[t, m]} contains the time t
#'   transition weights of the m:th regime.
#' @return a numeric vector containing the multivariate Gaussian densities, excluding the constant term.

#' @title Calculate log multivariate Gaussian densities
#' @description Calculates logs of multivariate Gaussian densities with constant mean
#'   and constant covariance matrix AND EXCLUDING the constant term of the density
#'   (the constant is calculated and added in R code).
#'
#' @param obs a \eqn{(T \times dp)} matrix such that the i:th row contains the vector
#'  \eqn{(y_{i-1}',...,y_{i-p}')} \eqn{((dp)x1)}, where \eqn{y_{i}=(y_{1i},...,y_{di})}
#'  \eqn{(dx1)}. That is, the initial values are included but the last observations not.
#' @param mean the \eqn{((dp)x1)} mean vector, \code{rep(all_mu[,m], times=p)}, that is the same for
#'  all observations.
#' @param cholcovmat the \eqn{(dp \times dp)} covariance matrix that is the same for all observations.
#' @details This function is used in the relative density transition weights with Gaussian regimes.
#' @return a numeric vector containing the multivariate Gaussian densities, excluding the constant term.
