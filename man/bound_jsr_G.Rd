\title{Calculate upper bound for the joint spectral radius of a set of matrices}
\usage{
bound_jsr_G(
  S,
  epsilon = 0.01,
  adaptive_eps = TRUE,
  ncores = 2,
  print_progress = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{S}{the set of matrices the bounds should be calculated for in an array, in VAR applications,
all \eqn{((dp)x(dp))} "bold A" (companion form) matrices in a 3D array, so that \code{[, , m]} gives the matrix
the regime \code{m}.}

\item{epsilon}{a strictly positive real number that approximately defines the goal of length of the interval between the lower
and upper bounds in Gripenberg's method. A smaller epsilon value results in a narrower interval, thus providing better
accuracy for the bounds, but at the cost of increased computational effort.}

\item{adaptive_eps}{logical: if \code{TRUE}, starts with a large epsilon and then decreases it gradually whenever the progress
of the algorithm requires, until the value given in the argument \code{epsilon} is reached. Substantially speeds up the algorithm
but is an unconventional approach, and there is no guarantee that the final bounds converge to the tightness of the bounds given by
the argument \code{epsilon}.}

\item{ncores}{the number of cores to be used in parallel computing in the Gripenberg's algorithm.}

\item{print_progress}{logical: should the progress of the Gripenberg's algorithm be printed?}
}
\value{
Returns an upper bound for the joint spectral radius of the "companion form AR matrices" of the regimes.

\description{
\code{bound_jsr_G} calculates lowr and upper bounds for the joint spectral radious of a set of square matrices,
 typically the "bold A" matrices, using the algorithm by Gripenberg (1996).
}
\details{
The bounds are calculated using the Gripenberg's (1996) branch-and-bound method, which is also discussed
 in Chand and Blondel (2013). Specifically, Kheifets and Saikkonen (2020) show that if the joint spectral radius
 of the companion form AR matrices of the regimes is smaller than one, the STVAR process is ergodic stationary. Therefore,
 if the upper bound is smaller than one, the process is stationary ergodic. However, as the condition is not
 necessary but sufficient and also because the bound might be too conservative, upper bound larger than one
 does not imply that the process is not ergodic stationary. You can try higher accuracy, and if the bound is
 still larger than one, the result does not tell whether the process is ergodic stationary or not.

 Note that with high precision (small \code{epsilon}), the computational effort required are substantial and
 the estimation may take very long, even though the function takes use of parallel computing. This is because
 with small epsilon the the number of candidate solutions in each iteration may grow exponentially and a large
 number of iterations may be required. For this reason, the algorithm starts with a large epsilon, and then
 decreases it when new candidate solutions are not found, until the desired epsilon is reached.

 You can also try other implementations for bounding the joint spectral radius, for instance,
 the JSR toolbox in MATLAB (Jungers 2023).
