\title{Get the transition weights alpha_mt}
\usage{
get_alpha_mt(
  data,
  p,
  M,
  weight_function,
  all_boldA,
  all_Omegas,
  weightpars,
  epsilon
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data a matrix or class \code{'ts'} object with \code{d>1} columns. Each column is taken to represent
a univariate time series. Missing values are not supported.}

\item{p}{a positive integer specifying the autoregressive order}

\item{M}{a positive integer specifying the number of regimes}

\item{weight_function}{what type of transition weights should be used?}

\item{all_boldA}{3D array containing the \eqn{((dp)x(dp))} "bold A" (companion form) matrices of each regime,
obtained from \code{form_boldA}. Will be computed if not given.}

\item{weightpars}{numerical vector containing the transition weight parameters, obtained from \code{pick_weightpars}.}

\item{epsilon}{the smallest number such that its exponent is wont classified as numerically zero
(around \code{-698} is used).}
}
\value{
Returns the mixing weights a \eqn{(T x M)} matrix, so that the t:th row is for the time point t
  and m:th column is for the regime m.
}
\description{
\code{get_alpha_mt} computes the transition weights.
}
\details{
Note that we index the time series as \eqn{-p+1,...,0,1,...,T}.
